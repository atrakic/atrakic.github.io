Yet another site based on Jekyll [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/) by a software engineer working with cloud infrastructure, software development, test automation, devops automation using docker, continuous delivery/integration and open source. 

My current interests are: docker, monitoring, ansible, python, go, AWS, serveless, lambda, jenkins ...
